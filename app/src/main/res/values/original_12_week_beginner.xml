        <item>NA~Turn It Up Tuesday: Aerobic Day or Active Rest Day~Using smart training practices means
            respecting one’s rest periods.  That means, for one’s “Fast Twitch” muscle fibers
            (the target with our main workouts), joints and nervous system to recover optimally,
            a rest day or two is needed. However, rest days don’t have to be lazy days.  In fact,
            active rest targeting “Slow Twitch” muscle fibers (which aerobic activity does) is a
            great change-up for burning calories and promoting recovery.  This on top of mobility
            and flexibility practices makes an ideal, in-between workout day.\n\n

            Choose from the following:\n
            Running, biking, hiking, stairs, swimming, basketball, soccer, frisbee, another sport,
            rock climbing, jumping jacks, burpees, high knees, skiing, cross-country skiing, snow
            shoeing, hopscotch, bear crawls, playing with the kids or whatever keeps you moving for…\n
            Beginners: 10 minutes\n\n

            Post Workout: Core and Stretch:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches and hold for 20-30 seconds each.  It’s okay to go through the
            stretch series a couple of times.  For an amazing post-workout stretch bonus, try foam
            rolling.  This is the perfect recovery enhancer and can be done anywhere (even if you do
            not own a foam roller (check out foam rolling on Dr. Oz earlier this year!)\n\n

            If you typically get sore after workouts, stretching immediately after a workout will
            help alleviate some of this.  As well, stretching POST-workout will help prevent injury,
            speed up muscle recovery and enhance overall fitness level. Go to the stretching section
            to get started on this recovery practice.\n\n

            Feel free to ask questions below, or in the community area.  We would love to hear your
            feedback, as well as see group interaction.</item>

        <item>NA~Mobility, Core and Stretch~Today is a light workout, focusing on your total core
            strength, range of motion and ending with foam rolling and stretching.  This will help
            speed up recovery and loosen up sore, tight muscles.\n\n
            Core and Stretching:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches from the Stretch Tab and hold for 20-30 seconds each.\n\n
            For Complete Fitness, Make Nutrition a Priority\n
            * Be sure to follow up every workout with a high (lean) protein snack and clean carb
            (fruit counts depending on which meal-plan you chose).  As well, drink plenty of water throughout the day and after workouts.\n\n

            * Follow your nutrition plan exactly and use the recipe board for substitutions for best results.  Let us know how we can assist
            you through your fitness journey.  Just remember, nutrition is close to 80% of the physical results, so don’t rely solely on exercise.

        <item>NA~Aerobic Day or Active Rest Day~Using smart training practices means respecting one’s rest periods.  That means, for one’s “Fast Twitch”
            muscle fibers (the target with our main workouts), joints and nervous system to recover optimally, a rest day or two is needed.\n\n

            However, rest days don’t have to be lazy days.  In fact, active rest targeting “Slow Twitch” muscle fibers (which aerobic activity does)
            is a great change-up for burning calories and promoting recovery.  This on top of mobility and flexibility practices makes an ideal,
            in-between workout day.\n\n

            Choose from the following:
            Running, biking, hiking, stairs, swimming, basketball, soccer, frisbee, another sport,
            rock climbing, jumping jacks, burpees, high knees, skiing, cross-country skiing, snow
            shoeing, hopscotch, bear crawls, playing with the kids or whatever keeps you moving for…\n
            Beginners: 22 minutes\n\n
            Post Workout: Core and Stretch:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches and hold for 20-30 seconds each.  It’s okay to go through the
            stretch series a couple of times.  For an amazing post-workout stretch bonus, try foam
            rolling.  This is the perfect recovery enhancer and can be done anywhere (even if you do
            not own a foam roller (check out foam rolling on Dr. Oz earlier this year!)\n\n

            If you typically get sore after workouts, stretching immediately after a workout will
            help alleviate some of this.  As well, stretching POST-workout will help prevent injury,
            speed up muscle recovery and enhance overall fitness level. Go to the stretching section
            to get started on this recovery practice.\n\n

            Feel free to ask questions below, or in the community area.  We would love to hear your
            feedback, as well as see group interaction.\n\n

            Beginners: 28 minutes\n\n
            Post Workout: Core and Stretch:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches and hold for 20-30 seconds each.  It’s okay to go through the
            stretch series a couple of times.  For an amazing post-workout stretch bonus, try foam
            rolling.  This is the perfect recovery enhancer and can be done anywhere (even if you do
            not own a foam roller (check out foam rolling on Dr. Oz earlier this year!)\n\n

            If you typically get sore after workouts, stretching immediately after a workout will
            help alleviate some of this.  As well, stretching POST-workout will help prevent injury,
            speed up muscle recovery and enhance overall fitness level. Go to the stretching section
            to get started on this recovery practice.\n\n

            Feel free to ask questions below, or in the community area.  We would love to hear your
            feedback, as well as see group interaction.\n\n
            Way to finish the week strong!  Keep up the great work and stick to your meal plan!  You rock!

        <item>NA~Turn It Up Tuesday: Aerobic Day or Active Rest Day~Using smart training practices means
            respecting one’s rest periods.  That means, for one’s “Fast Twitch” muscle fibers
            (the target with our main workouts), joints and nervous system to recover optimally,
            a rest day or two is needed. However, rest days don’t have to be lazy days.  In fact,
            active rest targeting “Slow Twitch” muscle fibers (which aerobic activity does) is a
            great change-up for burning calories and promoting recovery.  This on top of mobility
            and flexibility practices makes an ideal, in-between workout day.\n\n

            Choose from the following:\n
            Running, biking, hiking, stairs, swimming, basketball, soccer, frisbee, another sport,
            rock climbing, jumping jacks, burpees, high knees, skiing, cross-country skiing, snow
            shoeing, hopscotch, bear crawls, playing with the kids or whatever keeps you moving for…\n
            Beginners: 30 minutes\n\n

            Post Workout: Stretch and Cool Down:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches and hold for 20-30 seconds each.  It’s okay to go through the
            stretch series a couple of times.  For an amazing post-workout stretch bonus, try foam

        <item>NA~Mobility, Core and Stretch~Today is a light workout, focusing on your total core
            strength, range of motion and ending with foam rolling and stretching.  This will help
            speed up recovery and loosen up sore, tight muscles.\n\n
            Core and Stretching:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches from the Stretch Tab and hold for 20-30 seconds each.\n\n
            For Complete Fitness, Make Nutrition a Priority\n
            * Be sure to follow up every workout with a high (lean) protein snack and clean carb
            (fruit counts depending on which meal-plan you chose).  As well, drink plenty of water throughout the day and after workouts.\n\n

            * Follow your nutrition plan exactly and use the recipe board for substitutions for best results.  Let us know how we can assist
            you through your fitness journey.  Just remember, nutrition is close to 80% of the physical results, so don’t rely solely on exercise.
