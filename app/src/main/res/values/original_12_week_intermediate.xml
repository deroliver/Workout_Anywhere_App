        <item>NA~Turn It Up Tuesday: Aerobic Day or Active Rest Day~Using smart training practices means
            respecting one’s rest periods.  That means, for one’s “Fast Twitch” muscle fibers
            (the target with our main workouts), joints and nervous system to recover optimally,
            a rest day or two is needed. However, rest days don’t have to be lazy days.  In fact,
            active rest targeting “Slow Twitch” muscle fibers (which aerobic activity does) is a
            great change-up for burning calories and promoting recovery.  This on top of mobility
            and flexibility practices makes an ideal, in-between workout day.\n\n

            Choose from the following:\n
            Running, biking, hiking, stairs, swimming, basketball, soccer, frisbee, another sport,
            rock climbing, jumping jacks, burpees, high knees, skiing, cross-country skiing, snow
            shoeing, hopscotch, bear crawls, playing with the kids or whatever keeps you moving for…\n
            Intermediate: 12 minutes / Advanced: 15 minutes\n\n

            Post Workout: Core and Stretch:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches and hold for 20-30 seconds each.  It’s okay to go through the
            stretch series a couple of times.  For an amazing post-workout stretch bonus, try foam
            rolling.  This is the perfect recovery enhancer and can be done anywhere (even if you do
            not own a foam roller (check out foam rolling on Dr. Oz earlier this year!)\n\n

            If you typically get sore after workouts, stretching immediately after a workout will
            help alleviate some of this.  As well, stretching POST-workout will help prevent injury,
            speed up muscle recovery and enhance overall fitness level. Go to the stretching section
            to get started on this recovery practice.\n\n

        <item>NA~Turn It Up Tuesday: Aerobic Day or Active Rest Day~Using smart training practices means
            respecting one’s rest periods.  That means, for one’s “Fast Twitch” muscle fibers
            (the target with our main workouts), joints and nervous system to recover optimally,
            a rest day or two is needed. However, rest days don’t have to be lazy days.  In fact,
            active rest targeting “Slow Twitch” muscle fibers (which aerobic activity does) is a
            great change-up for burning calories and promoting recovery.  This on top of mobility
            and flexibility practices makes an ideal, in-between workout day.\n\n

            Choose from the following:\n
            Running, biking, hiking, stairs, swimming, basketball, soccer, frisbee, another sport,
            rock climbing, jumping jacks, burpees, high knees, skiing, cross-country skiing, snow
            shoeing, hopscotch, bear crawls, playing with the kids or whatever keeps you moving for…\n
            Intermediate: 21 minutes / Advanced: 24 minutes\n\n

            Post Workout: Core and Stretch:\n
            Pick at least 6 stretches and hold for 20-30 seconds each.  It’s okay to go through the
            stretch series a couple of times.  For an amazing post-workout stretch bonus, try foam
            rolling.  This is the perfect recovery enhancer and can be done anywhere (even if you do
            not own a foam roller (check out foam rolling on Dr. Oz earlier this year!)\n\n

            If you typically get sore after workouts, stretching immediately after a workout will
            help alleviate some of this.  As well, stretching POST-workout will help prevent injury,
            speed up muscle recovery and enhance overall fitness level. Go to the stretching section
            to get started on this recovery practice.\n\n

            Feel free to ask questions below, or in the community area.  We would love to hear your
            feedback, as well as see group interaction.</item>

            Post Workout: Core and Stretch:\n
            If you typically get sore after workouts, stretching immediately after a workout will help
            alleviate some of this.  As well, stretching POST-workout will help prevent injury, speed up
            muscle recovery and enhance overall fitness level. Go to the stretching section to get started
            on this recovery practice..

            RundleFit’s picks of the weeks to keep the intensity up and narrowing the gap between you and a sustainable, permanent healthy
            lifestyle (no rebounds!)\n\n
