# Workout_Anywhere_App
An android app for Workout Anywhere by RundleFit

This is one of my first attempts at a full fledged Android app.

I learned a bit of Java in a three week course last Winter, but the Android is all self taught.

WorkoutAnywhere is a health and fitness company in Spokane Washington that was looking for a developer
to write a mobile app.

They wanted an app that could simulate the experience their users have on their website.



Currently, I am beginning to work on the iOS version of the app.

This version is not fully completed, but is functioning.
